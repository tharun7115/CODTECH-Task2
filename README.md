## Overview of the Project

### Project : Movie Success Prediction: Evaluation and Comparison of Key Features

### Objective 
To predict the success of movies based on various features such as rating, votes, revenue, genre, director, and actors using a machine learning approach.


### key Activities
-**Data Preprocessing**:
<br>
Handle missing values in numerical and categorical columns.<br>
Encode categorical variables into numerical format using one-hot encoding.<br>

-**Feature Scaling**:<br>
Standardize numerical features to normalize data for better model performance.<br>

-**Model Development**:
<br>
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.<br>
Train a logistic regression model on the training data.<br>
Evaluate the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.<br>

-**Prediction and Evaluation**:
<br>
Use the trained model to predict movie success.<br>
Analyze performance metrics to assess the model's reliability.<br>

### Technologies Used
-**Python** :The primary programming lnguage for Data Preprocessing <br>
-**Pandas**: Facilitates data manipulation and analysis, including loading, transforming, and cleaning datasets.<br>
-**NumPy**: Provides efficient numerical computations for handling missing values and scaling data.<br>
-**Seaborn** & Matplotlib: For data visualization (if used further in exploratory analysis).<br>
-**Scikit-learn**: Offers robust tools for encoding, scaling, and implementing preprocessing techniques.<br>
